Amazon Clone Project Overview Welcome to my Amazon Clone project! As a passionate and aspiring student developer, I've undertaken the challenge of replicating the user interface and functionality of the Amazon website using HTML and CSS. This project aims to showcase my skills in front-end web development and serves as a practical application of the concepts I've learned during my studies.

Features Responsive Design: The project is designed to provide a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.

Product Display: I've implemented a product display section that mimics the layout of Amazon, showcasing various products with images, titles, and prices.

Technologies Used HTML: The structure of the web pages is built using HTML to define the content and layout.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets are employed to style the HTML elements, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and cohesive design.

How to Contribute While this project primarily serves as a demonstration of my skills, I welcome constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Feel free to clone the repository, explore the code, and provide insights that could enhance the project.

Acknowledgments I would like to express my gratitude to the online development community, educational resources, and mentors who have supported my learning journey. This project wouldn't have been possible without the knowledge and inspiration derived from these valuable sources.
